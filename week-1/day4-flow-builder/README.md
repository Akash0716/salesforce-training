# Types of Flows

## Screen Flow

A Screen Flow is an interactive flow that collects user input through screens.  
It is used when users need to enter or update information manually.  
Screen Flows guide users step-by-step through a process.

### Example
Student Registration Form

## Record Triggered Flow

A Record Triggered Flow runs automatically when a record is created, updated, or deleted.  
It is commonly used for background automation and business process management.  
These flows reduce manual tasks and automate system actions instantly.

# Manual vs Automated Process

## Process Chosen
Fee Payment Reminder System

---

## Manual Process

In a manual system, staff members check fee records regularly and send reminders individually through calls or emails.  
This process takes more time and may lead to missed reminders or delayed communication.

---

## Problems in Manual Process

- Time consuming
- Human errors
- Missed reminders
- Inconsistent communication
- Increased workload

---

## Automated Process Using Salesforce

Salesforce automatically checks fee due dates and sends reminder notifications to students before deadlines.  
This improves efficiency, consistency, and reduces manual effort.

# Reflection - Why Automation Matters

Companies automate repetitive business processes to improve productivity and reduce operational effort.  
Automation increases consistency, minimizes human errors, and speeds up workflow execution.  
Enterprise systems use automation to manage large-scale business operations efficiently.

Salesforce Flow Builder allows organizations to automate processes visually without coding.
